Item Input for Multiblocks
Basically an Advanced Stocking Input Bus (ME),but pull items from storage with higher priority first.
And try to consume items evenly from all storages then in reversed priority.
Can be used to trick Assembly Line into working, when recipe requires same items in different slots.
Use it as the last input bus of Assembly Line, and access other 15 buses' inventory via Storage Bus
and watch this bus do the trick.
Might carsh the machine and void materials if used improperly.
Shift+Screwdriver RMB to toggle reserve first slot if storage of highest priority is empty
